This is the readme file for my "cl-othello" project.  Inspired by Peter Norvig's
[[http://norvig.com/paip.html][example]] I wanted to implement my own version.  At the moment I have just
implemented a simple random move engine.  See [[http://www.cliki.net/cl-reversi][cl-reversi]] for a more
sophisticated example.

Simply type:

```
> (asdf:load-system :cl-othello)

> (in-package :cl-othello)

> (othello #'zufalls-zug #'mensch)
```

after downloading it to a place known by asdf and enjoy a simple game.
